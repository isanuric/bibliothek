        Today I'm dirty <br>
        And I want to be pretty <br>
        Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt <br>
        Today I'm dirty <br>
        And I want to be pretty<br>
        Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt<br>
        We are the nobodies<br>
        Wanna be somebodies<br>
        When we're dead<br>
        They'll know just who we are<br>
        We are the nobodies<br>
        Wanna be somebodies<br>
        When we're dead<br>
        They'll know just who we are
        Yesterday I was dirty
        Wanted to be pretty
        I know now that I'm forever dirt
        Yesterday I was dirty
        Wanted to be pretty
        I know now that I'm forever dirt
        We are the nobodies
        Wanna be somebodies
        When we're dead
        They'll know just who we are
        We are the nobodies
        Wanna be somebodies
        When we're dead
        They'll know just who we are
        Some children died the other day
        We fed machines and then we prayed
        Puked up and down in morbid faith
        You should have seen the ratings that day
        Some children died the other day
        We fed machines and then we prayed
        Puked up and down in morbid faith
        You should have seen the ratings that day
        We are the nobodies
        Wanna be somebodies
        When we're dead
        They'll know just who we are
        We are the nobodies
        Wanna be somebodies
        When we're dead
        They'll know just who we are
        We are the nobodies
        Wanna be somebodies
        When we're dead
        They'll know just who we are
        We are the nobodies
        Wanna be somebodies
        When we're dead
        They'll know just who we are</p>
